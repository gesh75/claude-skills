# Database Migration Patterns

Safe, reversible database schema changes for production systems.

## When to Activate

- Creating or altering database tables
- Adding/removing columns or indexes
- Running data migrations (backfill, transform)
- Planning zero-downtime schema changes
- Setting up migration tooling for a new project

## Core Principles

1. **Every change is a migration** — never alter production databases manually
2. **Migrations are forward-only in production** — rollbacks use new forward migrations
3. **Schema and data migrations are separate** — never mix DDL and DML in one migration
4. **Test migrations against production-sized data** — a migration that works on 100 rows may lock on 10M
5. **Migrations are immutable once deployed** — never edit a migration that has run in production

## Migration Safety Checklist

Before applying any migration:

- [ ] Migration has both UP and DOWN (or is explicitly marked irreversible)
- [ ] No full table locks on large tables (use concurrent operations)
- [ ] New columns have defaults or are nullable (never add NOT NULL without default)
- [ ] Indexes created concurrently (not inline with CREATE TABLE for existing tables)
- [ ] Data backfill is a separate migration from schema change
- [ ] Tested against a copy of production data
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Key Decision Rules

| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Adding a column | Nullable, or with a default (Postgres 11+ default is instant) |
| Adding NOT NULL | Add nullable → backfill → add constraint separately |
| Adding an index to a large table | `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (cannot run in a txn block) |
| Renaming a column | Never rename in place — use expand-contract |
| Removing a column | Remove code references first, drop column in a later deploy |
| Large data update | Batch with `LIMIT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, commit per batch |
| Schema + data change | Split into separate migrations |

See [reference/postgres.md](reference/postgres.md) for the exact SQL for each of these.

## Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy

For critical production changes, follow the expand-contract pattern:

```
Phase 1: EXPAND
  - Add new column/table (nullable or with default)
  - Deploy: app writes to BOTH old and new
  - Backfill existing data

Phase 2: MIGRATE
  - Deploy: app reads from NEW, writes to BOTH
  - Verify data consistency

Phase 3: CONTRACT
  - Deploy: app only uses NEW
  - Drop old column/table in separate migration
```

### Timeline Example

```
Day 1: Migration adds new_status column (nullable)
Day 1: Deploy app v2 — writes to both status and new_status
Day 2: Run backfill migration for existing rows
Day 3: Deploy app v3 — reads from new_status only
Day 7: Migration drops old status column
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Manual SQL in production | No audit trail, unrepeatable | Always use migration files |
| Editing deployed migrations | Causes drift between environments | Create new migration instead |
| NOT NULL without default | Locks table, rewrites all rows | Add nullable, backfill, then add constraint |
| Inline index on large table | Blocks writes during build | CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY |
| Schema + data in one migration | Hard to rollback, long transactions | Separate migrations |
| Dropping column before removing code | Application errors on missing column | Remove code first, drop column next deploy |

## Reference Files

- [reference/postgres.md](reference/postgres.md) — read when you need the exact PostgreSQL SQL for safe column adds, concurrent indexes, expand-contract renames, column removal, and batched data migrations.
- [reference/orms.md](reference/orms.md) — read when working with a specific migration tool; per-ORM CLI workflows and migration-file examples for Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely, Django, and golang-migrate.
