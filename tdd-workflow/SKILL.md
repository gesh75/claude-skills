# Test-Driven Development Workflow

This skill ensures all code development follows TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage.

## When to Activate

- Writing new features or functionality
- Fixing bugs or issues
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding API endpoints
- Creating new components

## Core Principles

### 1. Tests BEFORE Code
ALWAYS write tests first, then implement code to make tests pass.

### 2. Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% coverage (unit + integration + E2E)
- All edge cases covered
- Error scenarios tested
- Boundary conditions verified

### 3. Test Types

- **Unit** — individual functions and utilities, component logic, pure functions, helpers.
- **Integration** — API endpoints, database operations, service interactions, external API calls.
- **E2E (Playwright)** — critical user flows, complete workflows, browser automation, UI interactions.

Example code for each layer is in **reference/patterns.md**.

### 4. Git Checkpoints
- If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit after each TDD stage
- Do not squash or rewrite these checkpoint commits until the workflow is complete
- Each checkpoint commit message must describe the stage and the exact evidence captured
- Count only commits created on the current active branch for the current task
- Do not treat commits from other branches, earlier unrelated work, or distant branch history as valid checkpoint evidence
- Before treating a checkpoint as satisfied, verify that the commit is reachable from the current `HEAD` on the active branch and belongs to the current task sequence
- The preferred compact workflow is:
  - one commit for failing test added and RED validated
  - one commit for minimal fix applied and GREEN validated
  - one optional commit for refactor complete
- Separate evidence-only commits are not required if the test commit clearly corresponds to RED and the fix commit clearly corresponds to GREEN

## TDD Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Write User Journeys
Capture each as `As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]`. See template in **reference/patterns.md**.

### Step 2: Generate Test Cases
For each user journey, create comprehensive test cases covering the happy path, edge cases, fallbacks, and sorting/ordering logic. See `describe`/`it` example in **reference/patterns.md**.

### Step 3: Run Tests (They Should Fail)
```bash
npm test
# Tests should fail - we haven't implemented yet
```

This step is mandatory and is the RED gate for all production changes.

Before modifying business logic or other production code, you must verify a valid RED state via one of these paths:
- Runtime RED:
  - The relevant test target compiles successfully
  - The new or changed test is actually executed
  - The result is RED
- Compile-time RED:
  - The new test newly instantiates, references, or exercises the buggy code path
  - The compile failure is itself the intended RED signal
- In either case, the failure is caused by the intended business-logic bug, undefined behavior, or missing implementation
- The failure is not caused only by unrelated syntax errors, broken test setup, missing dependencies, or unrelated regressions

A test that was only written but not compiled and executed does not count as RED.

Do not edit production code until this RED state is confirmed.

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after this stage is validated.
Recommended commit message format:
- `test: add reproducer for <feature or bug>`
- This commit may also serve as the RED validation checkpoint if the reproducer was compiled and executed and failed for the intended reason
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before continuing

### Step 4: Implement Code
Write minimal code to make tests pass (see implementation stub in **reference/patterns.md**).

If the repository is under Git, stage the minimal fix now but defer the checkpoint commit until GREEN is validated in Step 5.

### Step 5: Run Tests Again
```bash
npm test
# Tests should now pass
```

Rerun the same relevant test target after the fix and confirm the previously failing test is now GREEN.

Only after a valid GREEN result may you proceed to refactor.

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after GREEN is validated.
Recommended commit message format:
- `fix: <feature or bug>`
- The fix commit may also serve as the GREEN validation checkpoint if the same relevant test target was rerun and passed
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before continuing

### Step 6: Refactor
Improve code quality while keeping tests green:
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Optimize performance
- Enhance readability

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after refactoring is complete and tests remain green.
Recommended commit message format:
- `refactor: clean up after <feature or bug> implementation`
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before considering the TDD cycle complete

### Step 7: Verify Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
# Verify 80%+ coverage achieved
```

Coverage thresholds config and CI integration are in **reference/ci.md**.

> For running these RED/GREEN and coverage gates after the fact (post-hoc verification of an existing change), use the **verification-loop** skill rather than re-deriving the gate logic here.

## Testing Patterns

Full example code for the unit, integration, and E2E layers — plus test file organization and the common-mistakes FAIL/PASS pairs (implementation details vs. user-visible behavior, brittle vs. semantic selectors, test isolation) — is in **reference/patterns.md**.

## Mocking External Services

Mock setups for Supabase, Redis, and OpenAI to isolate unit tests are in **reference/mocks.md**.

## Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First** - Always TDD
2. **One Assert Per Test** - Focus on single behavior
3. **Descriptive Test Names** - Explain what's tested
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert** - Clear test structure
5. **Mock External Dependencies** - Isolate unit tests
6. **Test Edge Cases** - Null, undefined, empty, large
7. **Test Error Paths** - Not just happy paths
8. **Keep Tests Fast** - Unit tests < 50ms each
9. **Clean Up After Tests** - No side effects
10. **Review Coverage Reports** - Identify gaps

## Success Metrics

- 80%+ code coverage achieved
- All tests passing (green)
- No skipped or disabled tests
- Fast test execution (< 30s for unit tests)
- E2E tests cover critical user flows
- Tests catch bugs before production

**Remember**: Tests are not optional. They are the safety net that enables confident refactoring, rapid development, and production reliability.
